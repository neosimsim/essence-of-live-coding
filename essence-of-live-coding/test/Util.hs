{- | A quickcheckable unit test for migrations of cells.

You have to specify a cell which will then receive some input,
is fed each input element in a step, and produces some output.
Then the cell is migrated to a second cell, which again consumes input and produces output.

The test is passed if the same input produces the same output.

* 'cell1': The cell before the migration
* 'cell2': The cell after the migration
* 'input1': All input the cell before the migration receives
* 'input2': All input the cell after the migration receives
* 'output1': The expected output before the migration
* 'output2': The expected output after the migration
